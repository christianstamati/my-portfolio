                <p className={`${cabinetGrotesk.className} font-normal`}>
                    Iâ€™m a developer based in Italy with an avid passion for building digital products. I love the entire
                    process: from the initial idea from the steak holders, to the UX/UI design and finally to the actual
                    code implementation of the solution. <br /> I studied as a Graphic Designer at ISSM high-school in
                    Venice and then I moved in Milan where I got my bachelor degree at NABA as a Creative Technologist.
                    During the university years I learned to work with Unity and Unreal Engine and after graduation I
                    was selected to participate at a virtual production project as a Technical Artist, it was a great
                    opportunity working on such a big project. <br /> As a developer, I strive to offer a functional and
                    professional solution. I often like to plan with the steak holders the architecture of the system so
                    we can come out with the best possible design solution. I would prefer to let my work speak for
                    itself so feel free to have a look through.
